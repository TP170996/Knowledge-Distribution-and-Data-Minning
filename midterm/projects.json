The long-term goal of his research is to create new approaches to design and evolve large-scale systems that consist of interacting engineered and social components. The increasing interconnectivity of modern systems ranging from transportation systems to healthcare delivery systems to app ecosystems has rendered many traditional approaches to systems engineering inadequate. Central to resolving this this dilemma is the development of techniques to computationally model these systems in a way that is useful for engineers. Understanding how to construct and use these types of computational models, with a particular emphasis on integrating human and social factors, has been the central focus of his research.&nbsp;<\/span><\/font><\/p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; line-height: 1.5em;\"><font face=\"Calibri, Candara, Segoe, Optima, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Michael has been PI or Co-PI on multiple sponsored research projects including sponsors such as the US Department of Defense and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Recent projects include employing machine learning techniques to identify modularity violations in cyber-physical systems, adapting graphical analysis methods to understand the composability of computational models, using simulation to understand the adoption of evidence based interventions in the US healthcare system, and analyzing policies to deter counterfeit electronic parts in supply chains. Results from this research have been directly integrated into the courses he teaches in the areas of statistics, operations research, and decision analysis.<\/span><\/font><\/p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Candara, Segoe, Optima, sans-serif;\">Michael has also worked as a senior systems engineer in various lead technical roles for the Northrop Grumman Corporation.

or companies. In her faculty appointment as Industry Professor at Stevens, Ms. Lepore serves at the executive level to advance and grow Systems Engineering education and research via new programs and projects and is Program Director of Stevens\u2019 inaugural Master\u2019s of Engineering in Technical Leadership program. She works with key industry and government sponsors in the space, aerospace, and defense domains, and facilitates outreach with partner organizations such as the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), Women in Aerospace (WIA), and the International Space University (ISU). Ms. Lepore also serves as Director of Strategic Programs for the Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC), the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) that Stevens leads for the Department of Defense, with 20 collaborating schools and over 200 researchers around the country.<\/font><\/p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: Calibri, Candara, Segoe, Optima, sans-serif;\"><font my=\"my\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: transparent;\">Her most recent venture was as President and an owner of AirLaunch LLC in Kirkland, Washington. AirLaunch won ~$38 million in funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the U.S. Air Force to develop a small launch vehicle to affordably and responsively deploy small satellites to space from a C-17 cargo airplane. Ms. Lepore led the company\u2019s external activities, including interaction with customers and senior government leaders, as well as development and execution of the company\u2019s business and strategic plans. The team set records for the longest (66 feet) and heaviest (72,000 pounds) objects dropped from a C-17 aircraft and for the longest duration vapor pressurization (VaPak) engine test fire (at 191 seconds). AirLaunch received two patents for innovative airdrop techniques \u2013 gravity air drop (from inside an airplane) and trapeze lanyard (t\/LAD, for belly launch underneath an airplane). The DARPA\/Air Force program, and company operations, concluded in late 2008.<\/font><\/p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: Calibri, Candara, Segoe, Optima, sans-serif;\"><font my=\"my\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: transparent;\">Ms. Lepore\u2019s first commercial venture began in 1997 at Kistler Aerospace Corporation in Kirkland, Washington, developer of the privately-funded K-1 reusable aerospace vehicle. As Vice President of Business Development and Strategic Planning, she identified, developed, and executed new business opportunities, as well as conducted short-term and long-term strategic planning. She was a key player in raising over $600 million private capital and setting the stage for emerging space launch companies to provide innovative services to US government customers. She led Kistler\u2019s unsolicited proposal to NASA in April 1999 for International Space Station (ISS) resupply services and negotiated an innovative commercial contract with NASA, valued at up to $135 million, under the Space Launch Initiative (SLI) Program in 2001. These two activities ultimately begat, nearly 10 years later, what are now NASA\u2019s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) and Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) programs.<\/font><\/p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: Calibri, Candara, Segoe, Optima, sans-serif;\"><font my=\"my\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: transparent;\">She began her career as an aerospace engineer working on strategic defense projects at ANSER (Analytic Services, Inc.) in Arlington, Virginia. After the Cold War ended, she served as Chief of Moscow (Russia) Operations for ANSER\u2019s Center for International Aerospace Cooperation and facilitated joint aerospace projects with the former Soviet Union. Over the course of her career, Ms. Lepore has conducted business and interacted with government and commercial entities around the world, including the U.S., Russia, Ukraine, Europe, Japan, Canada, India, Australia, and South Korea.

The long-term goal of his research is to create new approaches to design and evolve large-scale systems that consist of interacting engineered and social components. The increasing interconnectivity of modern systems ranging from transportation systems to healthcare delivery systems to app ecosystems has rendered many traditional approaches to systems engineering inadequate. Central to resolving this this dilemma is the development of techniques to computationally model these systems in a way that is useful for engineers. Understanding how to construct and use these types of computational models, with a particular emphasis on integrating human and social factors, has been the central focus of his research.&nbsp;<\/span><\/font><\/p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; line-height: 1.5em;\"><font face=\"Calibri, Candara, Segoe, Optima, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Michael has been PI or Co-PI on multiple sponsored research projects including sponsors such as the US Department of Defense and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

In that position he directs research applying UUVs and acoustic technology to the protection of ports and maritime assets, and research related to UUV operations in estuaries. \u00a0He also leads research in supercavitation and the modeling and control of supercavitating vehicles.<\/font><\/div><div style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: transparent;\"><\/div><div style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: transparent;\"><font my=\"my\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: transparent;\">In 27 years of working with UUVs John Dzielski has been responsible for developing and validating dynamical models for new and existing undersea vehicles. \u00a0He has designed and supervised the implementation of autopilot and navigation algorithms for UUVs, the autonomous mission capabilities that make those vehicles useful, and the distributed real-time simulations of undersea systems that support integration, testing, and simulation-based performance evaluation. \u00a0He has worked on numerous UUV programs ranging in size from 20kg to over 8200kg and mission times from minutes to days. \u00a0He has been involved in research and development of technology related to supercavitating vehicles and the development of control system concepts for those vehicles since 1995. \u00a0Before joining Penn State, he worked at the C. S.

The long-term goal of his research is to create new approaches to design and evolve large-scale systems that consist of interacting engineered and social components. The increasing interconnectivity of modern systems ranging from transportation systems to healthcare delivery systems to app ecosystems has rendered many traditional approaches to systems engineering inadequate. Central to resolving this this dilemma is the development of techniques to computationally model these systems in a way that is useful for engineers. Understanding how to construct and use these types of computational models, with a particular emphasis on integrating human and social factors, has been the central focus of his research.&nbsp;<\/span><\/font><\/p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; line-height: 1.5em;\"><font face=\"Calibri, Candara, Segoe, Optima, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Michael has been PI or Co-PI on multiple sponsored research projects including sponsors such as the US Department of Defense and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
